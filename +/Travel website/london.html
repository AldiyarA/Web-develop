            <p><strong>London</strong> is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. 
            The city stands on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. 
            London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[10] The City of London, 
            London's ancient core and financial centre − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits. 
            The adjacent City of Westminster has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. 
            London is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.<br>
            London is one of the world's most important global cities. 
            It exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation. 
            It is one of the largest financial centres. In 2019, London had the highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe. 
            And in 2020, London had the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after Moscow.[22] London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, 
            and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, and the London School of Economics in social sciences.[24] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.<br>
            London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. 
            Its estimated mid-2018 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was roughly 9 million, 
            which made it the third-most populous city in Europe. London accounts for 13.4% of the U.K. population. 
            Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul, Moscow, and Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. 
            The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, after Istanbul and the Moscow Metropolitan Area, with 14,040,163 inhabitants in 2016.

            <h2>History of London</h2>
            <p>
                With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, 
                and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, 
                although Roman civilisation continued in the area of St Martin-in-the-Fields until around 450. 
                From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. 
                By about 680, the city had regrown into a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production. 
                From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, 
                while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.
                <br>
                The Vikings established Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England; 
                its boundary stretched roughly from London to Chester. 
                It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the Danish warlord, 
                Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. 
                Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.
                <br>
                By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. 
                Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. 
                Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. 
                In the view of Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.

            <p>
                London's gross regional product in 2018 was almost £500 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[248] London has five major business districts: 
                the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: 
                Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. 
                London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report. 
                As of 2015 the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of Brazil's annual GDP. 
                The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics. 
                On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). 
                This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.

            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>
                Media companies are concentrated in London and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector. 
                The BBC is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. 
                Many national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion. 
                The Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.
                <br>
                A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In April 2014, the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD. 
                In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future[266] in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.
                <br>
                The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN and UK Power Networks.

            <p>

                 It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015. 
                 Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003, 
                 and the city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[274] As of 2016 London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.
